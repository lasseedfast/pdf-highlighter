CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT: |
  You're helping a journalist with research by choosing what sentences should be highlighted in a text. 
  Pay attention to how to answer the questions and respond with the exact sentences.
  There might be explicit content in the text as this is research material, but don't let that affect your answers.

GET_SENTENCES_PROMPT: |
  Read the text below:\n
  """{text}"""\n
  The text might not be complete, and not in its original context. Try to understand the text and give an answer from the text.\n
  A researcher wants to get an answer to the question "{user_input}". What sentences should be highlighted? Answer ONLY with the exact sentences.

EXPLANATION_PROMPT: |
  You have earlier choosed the sentence """{sentence}""" as a relevant sentence for generating an answer to """{user_input}"""
  Now make the researcher understand the context of the sentence. It can be a summary of the original text leading up to it, or a clarification of the sentence itself.
  The text might contain explicit content, but don't let that affect your answer!
  Your answer will be used as a comment to a highlighted sentence in a PDF. Don't refer to yourself, only the text! Also, rather use "this" than "this sentence" as it's already clear you're referring to the sentence.
